# VSCode and GitHub Integration

The tasks listed below are designed to help you set up and master the integration between Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and GitHub, enabling you to efficiently manage your research projects and collaborate with others.

## Set Up Your VSCode with GitHub Integration

### Background:

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a versatile code editor that supports a wide range of programming languages and tools. Its built-in Git functionality integrated with GitHub, offers a streamlined environment for you to manage your code and collaborate effectively. This setup is crucial for maintaining a productive workflow in your projects.

### Actions:

1. **Install VSCode and Required extensions**: Ensure you have VSCode installed on your machine. Proceed to install necessary [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) including Python, Git Graph, GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, and GitHub Copilot.
2. **Connect VSCode to Your GitHub Account**: Authenticate VSCode with your GitHub account using the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension.
3. **Clone Your GitHub Repository**: Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows; `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) in VSCode to execute the 'Git: Clone' command and clone your project repository.

### Measurable Objective:

You should have VSCode configured with your GitHub account, all relevant extensions installed, and your project repository cloned and ready for development.


## Master Your VSCode Workspace and Utilise the Plugin Ecosystem

### Background:

[VSCode workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) and [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) can significantly enhance your productivity by managing project files and settings efficiently and aiding in various development tasks.

### Actions:

1. **Set Up and Customise Your Workspace**: Set up a VSCode workspace tailored to your project. Learn to configure settings and understand the workspace file structure.
2. **Leverage Your extensions**: Engage with your installed extensions to perform common development tasks, such as debugging with [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), visualising Git history with [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph), and writing code with [GitHub Copilot (free for education users)](https://github.com/features/copilot/).

### Measurable Objective:

You should be able to create and customise your own VSCode workspace for your project needs and effectively use extensions to enhance your coding and debugging efficiency.


## Learn Basic Git Operations and GitHub Workflow in VSCode

### Background:

Understanding basic Git operations and GitHub flow is essential for managing project changes and collaboration. VSCode simplifies these processes through its integrated tools.

PS: LinkedIn Learning offers a [course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/using-git-with-visual-studio-code/git-is-better-in-visual-studio-code?u=69919578) on using VSCode for Git operations.

### Actions:

1. **Master Basic Git Operations**: Learn how to perform essential Git operations like commit, push, pull, and branch directly within VSCode using the source control menu.
2. **Simulate GitHub Flow**: Practise the full [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) by:
   - Opening an issue in GitHub.
   - Creating a corresponding branch for the issue in VSCode.
   - Making changes, committing them, and pushing the branch.
   - Creating and merging a pull request in VSCode.
   - Closing the issue once merged.

### Measurable Objective:

You should be able to independently execute basic Git operations in VSCode and complete the GitHub workflow from issue creation to pull request merging.
