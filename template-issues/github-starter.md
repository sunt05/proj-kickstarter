# GitHub Starter

The tasks listed below are designed to help you get started with GitHub, a powerful platform for collaboration and project management.
By completing these tasks, you will learn how to navigate GitHub repositories, create and manage issues, and organise your research tasks using GitHub Projects.

## Explore and Understand Your GitHub Repository

### Background
Your GitHub repository is your project's home, where all files, discussions, and history are stored.
Familiarising yourself with its structure and features is the first step in utilising GitHub effectively for your research.

### Actions
1. **Tour the Repository:** Start by exploring the repository that's been set up for you. Pay special attention to [the README file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes), as it often contains important information about the project.
2. **Learn Markdown Basics:** Markdown is a simple language used to format text on GitHub. Read [this brief tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) on Markdown to learn how to format text in issues and README files. Focus on headings, lists, links, and basic styling.

### Measurable Objective
After completing this task, you should be able to describe what a README file is for, and use basic Markdown to format text in GitHub comments and documents.

## Dive Into GitHub Issues

### Background
GitHub Issues are a powerful tool for organising discussions, tracking tasks, and collaborating on projects. They will be your primary tool for communicating research ideas, questions, and updates.

### Actions
1. **Create Your First Issue:** [Open a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) in the repository to discuss a potential research question or a task you think needs to be addressed. Use Markdown to format your issue description.
2. **Experiment with Labels and Assignees:** Assign the issue to yourself and add a label to it, such as "discussion" or "task", to categorise the issue. This helps in organising and prioritising tasks.
3. **Comment on an Existing Issue:** Find an existing issue in the repository and add a comment to contribute to the discussion or provide an update on the task's progress.
4. **Break the Issue into Smaller Tasks:** Depending on the complexity of the issue, you can create multiple subtasks using the checklist feature in the issue description. Note:
	- Each subtask should be a small, manageable unit of work that contributes to the completion of the main issue.
	- [The subtasks can be easily converted into issues if needed.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists)
5. **Close an Issue:** If you've completed a task or resolved a discussion, close the issue to indicate that it's done. You can always reopen it if needed.

### Measurable Objective
You should be comfortable with creating an issue, formatting the description with Markdown, assigning issues to yourself (or relevant collaborators if applicable), categorising them with labels, and closing issues when they are resolved.

## Organise Your Work with GitHub Projects

### Background
Managing and tracking your research tasks efficiently is crucial for progress. GitHub Projects offers a kanban-style board to visually organise tasks, represented by issues, in various stages of completion.

### Actions
1. **Upload a Research File:** Practise [uploading a file](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository) related to your research to the repository. This could be a dataset, a literature review document, or any other relevant file.
2. **Set Up Your Project Board:** Create [a new project in the "Projects" tab](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#creating-a-user-project) of the repository. Add columns like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" to represent different stages of task completion.
3. **Link Issues to Your Project Board:** [Add the issue you created earlier to your project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#adding-issues-to-your-project) and move it to the appropriate column based on its current status.

### Measurable Objective
Successfully upload a research-related file to the repository, set up a project board with at least three columns, and manage your tasks by moving issues through the columns on the board.
